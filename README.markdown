# GetDoc

GetDoc easily fetches the contents of a published Google word processing document for use within another web page.  It acts as a simple CMS by allowing the owner of the Google document to edit the contents of the page.

# Setup

1. Make sure that you have eRuby installed, or else use inside of a Rails erb file (rhtml).
2. Make the "cache" folder writeable, e.g. "chmod a+w cache"

# Usage

See the sample.rhtml file for sample usage.
